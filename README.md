This repository was created to contain the source code for the automated processing of EHR correspondence for the development of a Machine Learning model for Intellectual Disability detection.
The automated processing consists of text extraction, de-identification and two types of feature extraction methods: bag-of-words and clinical concept extraction.

This project was performed by Joyce Rijs as Thesis for MSc Technical Medicine (joint degree: TU Delft, Erasmus MC, LUMC) from September 2023 - March 2024.

This project was initiated by Laura de Graaff (Internist-Endocrinologist at Erasmus MC) and Jifke Veenland (Researcher and Education Innovator at Erasmus MC).

NB: For clinical concept extraction, the MedSpacy toolkit was used. The English dependencies and language context rules were replaced by Dutch versions by T. Seinen (1). 
This Dutch MedSpacy toolkit was not published yet and therefore not included in this repository.
